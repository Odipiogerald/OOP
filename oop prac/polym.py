# Polymorphism allows objects of 
# different classes to be treated 
# as objects of a common superclass.
# It provides a way to perform a single action 
# in different ways.
# Method Overriding occurs when 
# a child class provides a 
# specific implementation of a method 
# already defined in its parent class.
